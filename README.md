# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

This is a simple Model trained for 10 different types of Gestures. Dataset contains 500 binary thresholded images in each gesture. I used a CNN model and OpenCV to read real-time data from the user. The training of the model has been enclosed in model_training.ipynb. I also attached the weight file of the model. You can use keras module to load it to your environment.
